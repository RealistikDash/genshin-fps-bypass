 An FPS bypass for Genshin Impact written in Python, allowing you to unlock the FPS cap.
 
 ## What is this?
 This tool allows you to unlock the hardcoded FPS cap, allowing you play at higher frame rates than 60fps.
 This means you can now make the most of your 144hz (or higher) monitor.
 
 It allows you to manually specify the FPS you wish the game to run.
